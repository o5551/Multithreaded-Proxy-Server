# Multithreaded-Proxy-Server
A high-performance multithreaded proxy server implemented in Java. It handles multiple client requests concurrently using a thread pool and optimizes repeated web responses using a custom-built Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. The server supports HTTP GET requests and demonstrates efficient network I/O, synchronization, and caching techniques.
